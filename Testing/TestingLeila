For the most part, majority of the front end was done using the story board funciton in Swift. For many reasons including constraints, the design in story board appeared different than it did in the simulation. It was mostly trial and error and in a few cases I hard-coded into the view-contoller file, but it was a process of repiption and trying new things to get the front end functioning. In some instances where the program would trash (mostly due to naming errors), I would go through and comment out certain features to specify what the problem was.
